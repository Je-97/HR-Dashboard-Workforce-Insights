## Data Modeling & Relationships ##

The original dataset was a single flat table. Using Power Query, I was able to transform and split the data into multiple dimensionally-structured tables such as:

EmployeeInfo

Performance

Salary

JobInfo

ExperienceInfo

EducationInfo

I also created a separate Departments table to normalize department-related data and establish clean one-to-many relationships across the model.

The relationships were built primarily using EmployeeNumber as a common key across the fact tables, enabling comprehensive and dynamic analysis.

This structure allowed me to visualize and explore key HR insights such as:

Attrition rate per department

Monthly pay vs. job satisfaction by role

Job level vs. performance & satisfaction

Gender distribution

Experience and tenure metrics
